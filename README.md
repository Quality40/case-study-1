The dataset for this case study includes wine samples from the “Vinho
Verde” winery in Portugal (//www3.dsi.uminho.pt./pcortez/wine/). The
samples were collected during the production process to monitor their 
quality; a score (between 0 and 10) based on sensory data. The lower the
score, the lower the quality. The dataset includes two different samples
from white and red wines. The former is the one used in this study. It
includes 4898 samples; predictive features and the target variable (i.e.,
quality score).
